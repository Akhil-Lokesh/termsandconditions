Using the Platform4.1 Our Platform and business modelThe Platform allows you and others to create, view and share content, and interact with others. We also personalise parts of your experience on the Platform, such as the “For You” feed. The “For You” feed uses a recommendation system to allow you to discover a breadth of content, creators and topics that are likely to be interesting for you. In deciding what gets recommended, the system takes into account factors such as likes, shares, comments, searches, diversity of content, and popular videos. Learn more about the recommendation system and the tools you can use to customise your feed here (this information forms part of these Terms).We want the Platform to be a safe place, so people can be who they are and have fun. We work with our Affiliates and use a mix of technology (including through automated means), human moderation, and reports from users to identify breaches of and enforce these Terms and our Community Guidelines and any additional applicable terms and take action to protect our users.We don't charge you a fee to use most of the features of the Platform. Instead, some individuals and businesses pay us to show advertisements. We may also charge sellers a commission on products sold on TikTok Shop.We charge you for some features of the Platform, for example, if you buy virtual coins (see our Virtual Items Policy). However, you don’t have to use these features and any costs will be made clear to you before you are charged anything.Information on how we use data we collect about you can be found in our Privacy Policy and Cookies Policy. These do not form part of these Terms but are important documents which we strongly recommend that you read.In short: The Platform allows you to create, view and share content, and interact with others. You do not have to pay to use most features on our Platform but, in exchange, we allow some individuals and businesses to advertise and we receive payment for this.4.2 Account detailsYou can use some basic features of the Platform without having an account. If you use the Platform without an account, these Terms will still apply and we will still process your personal data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.To access the full functionality of the Platform, you must create an account with us.

You must not create an account if we have previously terminated an account in your name for breaching these Terms or our Community Guidelines.When you create an account:you must provide accurate and up-to-date information about yourself (such as your date of birth);your account, content and Platform settings will sync across the Platform, including across each TikTok app. For example, when you create an account via TikTok, you will be able to access any other TikTok apps available in your country using that account; and you agree to maintain and promptly update your details if they change. See our Help Center for information about opening an account. Any changes you make to these details, content or settings, will also sync across the Platform.It is important that you take reasonable steps to keep your account password secure and do not disclose it to any third party. If you know or suspect that any third party knows your password or has accessed your account, please let us know straight away here.In short: Your account is important. Keep it safe and up to date.

We monitor for underage use and will suspend (whilst we investigate) or terminate your account if we reasonably suspect you are underage or are allowing someone underage to use your account.

If you see something that should not be on our Platform, please tell us.4.6 Your contentIt is important you understand what happens to the content you create, post or share on the Platform:You are responsible for the content you make available on the Platform and you should have all the rights needed to create, post or share it.Content you create, post or share via one TikTok service may be automatically shared across the Platform.We review content both proactively and reactively. For example, we have systems to detect content that breaches our rules and we respond to notices from users and authorities. To do this we use a combination of technology and human moderators. Our approach to content moderation is explained here (the information on this page forms part of these Terms).We may restrict access to or remove any content, including yours, if we reasonably believe (i) it is in breach of these Terms or our Community Guidelines; or (ii) it causes harm to us, Affiliates, other users or third parties. Our Community Guidelines set out how content might be removed or restricted on the Platform.If we remove or restrict access to your content, we will notify you without undue delay and let you know the reasons for our decision, unless it is not appropriate for us to do so (for example, we are legally prevented from doing so).If you think we have made a mistake in removing or restricting access to your content, you can appeal through the functionality provided on the Platform. When you do this we will review our decision and decide again. More information on how to submit an appeal, our complaint handling process and other redress options is set out here (the information on this page forms part of these Terms).You are free to remove your content from the Platform at any time.If other users of the Platform have used your content to create new content (e.g. by using Duet or Stitch), their that new content may stay on the Platform even if you delete your content or your account. Similarly, if they have shared your content on third party services, your content may stay on the third party service after you delete your content or account on the Platform. You can make a separate request for Duet or Stitch videos that contain your content to be deleted.You can restrict how other users interact with and use your content in your Platform settings. You should check these settings before you post content on the Platform.4.7 Posting Branded ContentIf you post content on the Platform promoting or reviewing a third party brand or its products or services in exchange for payment or any other incentive you must comply with the Branded Content Policy, unless you are using one of TikTok’s paid ad services (e.g. Promote or TikTok Ads Manager). You must use appropriate disclosures including any functionality we provide to ensure that any posts that are, for example, sponsored, are clear.In short: Where you post about a brand, product or service in return for any payment or other incentive, you should follow our Branded Content Policy and include any necessary disclosures, so your relationship is clear.4.8 Respecting the intellectual property rights of othersWe respect copyright and other intellectual property rights. Please read our Intellectual Property Policy. You can report suspected infringements of intellectual property rights on the Platform here:Copyright: https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/CopyrightTrademark: https://www.tiktok.com/legal/report/TrademarkIn short: You should read our Intellectual Property Policy and follow those additional rules.4.9 Ownership of content and grant of licencesWe don’t own your content. If you are the owner of the intellectual property rights in the content you create or share on the Platform, nothing in these Terms changes that.To provide the Platform, we need certain rights from you (called a licence). The details of these licences are set out below.By creating, posting or otherwise making content available on the Platform, you grant to TikTok and our Affiliates a licence to use your content which is:non-exclusive (this means you can still license your content to others),royalty-free (this means we don’t pay you for this licence),transferable (this means we can give the rights you give us to someone else),sub-licensable (this means we can license your content to others, e.g. to service providers that help us to provide the Platform or to trusted third parties that have entered into agreements with us to operate, develop and provide the Platform); andworldwide (this means the license applies anywhere in the world).This licence to use your content allows us to reproduce (e.g. to copy), adapt or make derivative works (e.g. to translate and/or create captions), perform and communicate your content to the public (e.g. to display it), for the purposes of operating, developing and providing the Platform, subject to your Platform settings.You also grant to each user of the Platform a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide licence to access and use your content, including to reproduce (e.g. to copy, share or download), adapt or make derivative works (e.g. to include your content in their content), perform and communicate your content to the public (e.g. to display it) using the Platform for entertainment purposes, subject to your Platform settings.Your licences to TikTok, our Affiliates and to users end when you close your account or when you or we remove your content from the Platform in accordance with these Terms. However, due to the nature of the Platform and our legal obligations, the licence granted will continue after you have removed your content if:you have allowed other users of the Platform to use or reuse your content via your Platform settings (e.g. by using Duet, Stitch, download or share functionalities); orwe are obliged to store or process your content for legal reasons.If you choose to submit comments, ideas or feedback to us, you agree we can use them for the purposes of operating, developing, improving and providing the Platform without paying you or giving you anything in return.In short: When you post content to the Platform, it remains yours. But we can use your content to provide the Platform, and if you choose to make it available to others, we can show it to other users. Those other users may be able to reuse it too. That is what our Platform is all about. If you later take it down, copies of it made by others may stay on the Platform.5. What we promise to youWe promise to use reasonable skill and care and to act with professional diligence for so long as we choose to offer the Platform. We will also take all reasonable steps to keep the Platform a safe and secure environment for our users. We do not promise to offer the Platform forever or in its current form for any particular period of time.The content on the Platform is mostly user generated content provided by the individuals and businesses that use our Platform. In other words, TikTok is not the creator of most of the content (although sometimes we might be). Therefore, subject to any regulations or laws applicable to TikTok, TikTok does not promise that any of the content generated by users that you find on the Platform:is accurate, complete or up-to-date;does not infringe third party rights;is legal; orwill not offend you.You acknowledge that the content you may see on the Platform does not represent our views or values and may not be suited to your purpose.The Platform may contain links to third party websites, advertisements, information, materials, products, services, offers or other events or activities that are not provided, owned or controlled by TikTok. We do not endorse these.Provided we have acted with professional diligence, we do not take responsibility for loss or damage caused by us, unless it is:caused by our breach of these Terms; orreasonably foreseeable at the time of entering into these Terms (i.e. either it is obvious that it will happen or it is known that it might happen).We do not take responsibility for loss or damage caused by events beyond our reasonable control.Nothing in these Terms affects any rights you are given by law and that you cannot contractually agree to alter or give up, or are legally always entitled to. For example, because you are a consumer.We do not exclude or limit our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so. You will always have the full protections of the laws that apply to you.If you are an EEA-based consumer, then EEA consumer laws provide you with a legal guarantee covering the Platform. If you have any questions about your legal guarantee, please contact us here.In short: We always want you to have a great and safe user experience, but you take the Platform as it is and understand we do not control everything on it. We also cannot promise all content posted on the Platform is to your liking. If you are an EEA consumer, you have a legal guarantee covering the Platform, and you can make a claim under this by contacting us.6. Restricting, suspending or ending our relationship6.1 Your rightsYou may end your relationship with TikTok at any time by simply closing your account and stopping your use of the Platform. Instructions for how to do this are in our Help Center. Consumers in the EEA can also withdraw from this contract using the model form here.In short: We want you to stay, but you can go whenever you want if you close your account and stop using the Platform.6.2 TikTok’s rightsIf we suspect you have breached these Terms or our Community Guidelines we may investigate. While we do so, we are allowed to restrict or take down some or all of your content, or suspend your access to some or all features of the Platform.We might temporarily suspend, permanently restrict or terminate your account, or impose limits on, or restrict your access to features of the Platform if:we determine that you are in material or repeated breach of these Terms or our Community Guidelines (for more information, see here);we have grounds to believe you are about to seriously breach these Terms or our Community Guidelines;we are legally required to do so; orit is necessary to deal with a serious technical or security issue.We will always act reasonably and objectively when exercising these rights.We will normally let you know before we suspend or terminate your account to allow you time to download your data in-app (more information about how to do this is available here). However, it may not always be appropriate for us to do so or we may reasonably believe that continued access to your account will cause material damage to us, Affiliates, our users or other third parties, or we may be legally prevented from doing so. Suspension or termination may happen without prior notice if special circumstances, having weighed your interests and ours against each other, justify immediate action.If you think we have made a mistake in restricting, suspending or terminating your account, you can appeal. If you do this we will review our decision and decide again. We will restore your access if our suspension or termination action was not justified.We can request that you install updates or automatically update or modify the Platform because of a security incident, or to deal with vulnerabilities or threats to the Platform.In short: We have rules you must follow. If you break them, we can take action against you which may include terminating your account.7. Changes to these Terms or the Platform7.1 What happens when we make changesWe may make changes to these Terms or the Platform from time to time. If we do, we will consider your reasonable interests before doing so.We will give you reasonable advance notice of significant changes which will impact you and confirm the date they will come into force. The changes will only apply from that date.Where we make time-sensitive changes for security, safety, legal or regulatory reasons, we may not give you advance notice, but we will let you know as soon as we are able to.If you do not agree to the changes to the Terms or the Platform, you should stop using the Platform.In short: Our Platform will not stay the same forever. If these Terms or the Platform changes significantly, we will tell you. It won’t change anything between us that has happened already but, if you want to keep using the Platform in the future, you will need to agree to the changes. Our Platform will evolve as we improve it.7.2 Reasons for changesReasons we might make changes to these Terms or the Platform are:changes in circumstances beyond our reasonable control;changes in the law;changes we make to the Platform in the usual course of developing our product;to adapt to new technologies;to reflect changes in the number of people who use the Platform or a feature or functionality of the Platform;to address a security issue; orto make these Terms clearer or easier to understand, or to correct administrative errors.In short: We can make changes to these Terms or the Platform for a limited number of reasons.8. Resolving disputesIf we have a dispute, we will first try and resolve it with you amicably.If you are a consumer, these Terms are governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which you live.If either of us wants to bring a legal claim, you or we can go to your local courts. You can also go to:the courts of the Republic of Ireland (for disputes with TikTok Technology Limited); andthe courts of England & Wales (for disputes with TikTok Information Technologies UK Limited).If you are operating a business, please see our Business Terms for details of how we’ll resolve disputes.In short: We hope we do not get into a dispute but, if we do, there are a couple of ways we can try to resolve it.9. OtherThese Terms, and any rights and permissions granted in them, cannot be transferred by you, but may be transferred by TikTok. If we do so, this will not negatively affect any rights you may have as a consumer. And, if you are not happy, you always have the right to terminate this contract and stop using the Platform at any time.In short: In the future we may sell all or part of our business or re-organise it. This means another company may end up providing the Platform to you.We may reclaim your account name if you have not logged into your account for 6 months or we reasonably believe your account name violates our Terms and/or Community Guidelines (e.g. your account name violates a third party trademark). Where we are legally able to do so, we might make your account name available to other users.In short: We may reclaim your account name if you don’t use it or breach these Terms.Even if we or you delay in enforcing these Terms, either of us can still enforce them later.In short: Just because you or we do not rely on one of these Terms, this does not change the fact that we both agree these Terms are the agreement between us.10.
